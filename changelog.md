# Changelog
All versions are properly annotated on [github](https://github.com/douweschulte/pdbtbx/releases) so there the source code for each version can be retrieved.

### v0.13.0 (upcoming)
* Updated MSRV to 1.67 (Jan 2023) (from 1.64 (Sep 2022)) which should be old enough for most things keep working
* Sped up PDB file opening, expect ~40% gain (Thanks to maxall41)
* Added `Atom::id` (Thanks to hfswetton)
* Added bond inference (Thanks to David-OConnor)
* Updated mismatched symmetry group error to warning (Thanks to David-OConnor)
* Removed dependency doc_cfg to prevent double dependencies in the tree
* Moved the `PDBError` into a separate crate (shared with another project: rusteomics/mzcore).
  This changes quite a lot of the exposed API but should be relatively easy to adapt to.

### v0.12.0
* Added unified file read logic, see `ReadOptions` (Thanks to y1zhou and OWisset)
  - This deprecates the original read functions `open_gz` (still around for ease of updating) and `open_raw` (fully removed in this update)
* Added `unique_conformer_names` for a `PDB` (Thanks to rvhonorato)
* Added `chains_in_contact` for a `PDB` (Thanks to rvhonorato)

### v0.11.0
* Added support for zipped (`.gz`) files (Thanks to OWisset)
* Does not automatically convert chain names to uppercase anymore (Thanks to OWisset)

* Added support for SCALE, ORIGX, and MTRIX in mmCIF files (open and save)
* Fixed ignoring some of the `auth_*` series of mmCIF columns, by giving them precedence over the `label_*` columns in `seq_id` and `asym_id` (thanks to #95)
* Fixed remark-type-number 400 missing from the valid number list (thanks to #96)
* Fixed a small bug in saving MtriX records (thanks to #96)

### v0.9.2

### v0.9.0 'Structured search'
* Added `find` method on all levels in the PDB, this should allow for human friendly atom(s) searching.
    `pdb.find(Term::ConformerName("ALA".to_string()) + Term::AtomName("CA".to_string()))`
* Added `bounding_box` to the PDB struct.
* Added `atom.overlaps_bound()` which uses covalent bond radii instead of unbound radii. (Thanks to raised issue)
* Extended `atomic_number` to take the first character of the name if this is one of "CHONS" and the element is unset and the name is not an element name.
* Updated covalent bond radii to work in Å as well (was picometers).
* Respecified the dependencies versions to allow cargo to more often reuse dependencies in complex projects.

### v0.8.0 'All the hierarchy'
* Added support for residue serial numbers over 9999 and atom serial numbers over 99999 for PDB files. (Thanks to DocKDE)
* Changed argument type of `save_pdb` from `PDB` to `&PDB`. (Thanks to DocKDE)
* Allow lack of chain name in PDB files. (Thanks to DocKDE)
* Added mutable structs to extend the use of `AtomWithHierarchy` alongside a refactor which created a struct for every hierarchy level. See the docs for more information.
* Removed `Atom.pos_array()` and moved the `rstar::rtree` to use `(f64, f64, f64)` instead of `[f64; 3]`. This was made possible by the adoption of tuples as points in rstar. 

### v0.7.0 'Ecosystem integration'
* Added parallel iterators based on [Rayon](https://crates.io/crates/rayon) (Thanks to DocKDE)
* Added support for generating r*trees from [Rstar](https://crates.io/crates/rstar), this has to be opted in by using the feature `rstar`
* Added support for serialization using [Serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde), this has to be opted in using the feature `serde`
* Added a new struct `AtomWithHierarchy` to have access to the containing layers of an atom in an easy way and added functions to generate and work with this struct
* Added `binary_find_atom` to all hierarchies to find atoms in less time
* Added more names for amino acids and backbone atoms (Thanks to DocKDE)
* Added support for bonds (can only read Disulfide bonds from PDBs for now)
* And many more small fixes and docs updates

* Fixed a bug in `atom.atomic_radius()`, it used to give the radius of the previous atom in the periodic table
* Added more atomic radii (vanderwaals and covalent bonds)

### v0.6.1 
* Fixed a bug arbitrarily constraining the maximum value of atom serial numbers in PDB files

### v0.6.0 'Hetero atoms remastered'

* Implemented the standard traits (Clone/PartialEq/Eq/PartialOrd/Ord) for most structures
* Fixed conformers in `pdb.renumber()` they were disregarded before
* The symmetry structure now also accepts and provides Hall symbols
* Fixed multiple bugs
* Added many more unit tests and started tracking test coverage

### v0.5.1

* Added support for negative residue sequence numbers
* Standardised the precision of floating points in the mmCIF output, at least 1 and at most 5 decimals will be shown
* Fixed an issue with the occupancy of atoms shared between multiple conformers, it will now add up to the original value 

### v0.5.0 'Alternative location support'

* Added editing functions for Conformers
* Added `HEADER` identifier support for parsing PDB and saving PDB and mmCIF
* Reverted mmCIF output atom_site column ordering to v0.3.3, the newly introduced ordering gave issues with Phenix

* Added `validate_pdb` to validate a PDB model before saving it in a PDB file
* Added support for bigger serial numbers and names to allow for bigger models to be saved in mmCIF files
* Fixed some issues with mmCIF output

### v0.3.3
* Added very basic exporting to mmCIF, it will only export the unit cell, symmetry and atomic data. 

### v0.3.2
* Added saving of `DBREF`/`SEQADV`/`SEQRES`
* Generates default matrices for `SCALE` and `ORIGX` if not available and the strictness level on save is `Strict`

* Extended warnings for validation of ensemble files, it will now generate a `LooseWarning` if `HETATM`s do not correspond
* Changed the implementation of the `.remove_*_by` functions to be 75% faster

### v0.2.0
* Made `add_child` methods for model/chain/residue public.
* Extended saving it now validates and renumbers the given PDB. It fails upon generation of validation errors, while the user can specify the error levels to allow
* Added save_raw to save to a BufWriter. This function is called `save_raw`.
* Extended parser error generation and handling. It now fails upon generation of errors, while the user can specify the error levels to allow
